Here are the key insights from the dataset:
<br>

1.General Information:
<br>

*The dataset contains 1480 entries and 38 columns.
<br>
*There are no missing values in the dataset.
<br>

2.Unique Values:
<br>

*Columns like StandardHours have a single unique value (80), indicating that all employees have the same standard working hours.
<br>
*Columns like EmployeeCount and Over18 also have a single unique value, which might not be useful for analysis.
<br>

3.Categorical Columns:
<br>

*Attrition, BusinessTravel, Department, EducationField, Gender, JobRole, MaritalStatus, OverTime are some of the categorical columns.
<br>
*These columns can be used for visualizations like bar charts or pie charts to show distributions.
<br>

4.Numerical Columns:
<br>

*Age, DailyRate, DistanceFromHome, MonthlyIncome, MonthlyRate, TotalWorkingYears, YearsAtCompany, etc., are numerical columns.
<br>
*These columns can be used for visualizations like histograms, box plots, or scatter plots to show distributions and relationships.
<br>

5.Potential Visualizations:
<br>

*Attrition Analysis: Visualize the distribution of attrition across different departments, job roles, and age groups.
<br>
*Income Analysis: Visualize the distribution of monthly income across different job roles and departments.
<br>
*Travel Frequency: Visualize the distribution of business travel frequency across different job roles and departments.
<br>
*Satisfaction Levels: Visualize the distribution of job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction across different age groups and departments.
